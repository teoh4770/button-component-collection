Challenge: Create a reusable button with all the states in the design and a page displaying all the states

User story: I can see different button types: default, outline and text
User story: I can choose to disable box-shadow
User story: I can choose to disable the button
User story: I can choose to have an icon on the left or right (Use Google Icon and at least 5 variants)
User story: I can have different button sizes
User story: I can have different colors
User story: When I hover or focus, I can see visual indicators
User story: I can still access all button attributes
User story (optional): Show button in a similar way like the design or use Storybook. Otherwise, showing the button in multiple states is enough
